# Data Analysis and Visualization Script

## Overview
This Python script is designed to load, explore, analyze, and visualize a dataset in CSV format. It provides a structured workflow for handling data, performing basic analysis, and generating insightful visualizations.

## Features
### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- Loads a dataset in CSV format using `pandas`.
- Displays the first few rows of the dataset to inspect its structure.
- Explores the dataset's structure by checking data types and missing values.
- Cleans the dataset by forward-filling missing values.

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Computes basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Groups data by a categorical column and calculates the mean of a numerical column for each group.
- Identifies patterns or interesting findings from the analysis.

### Task 3: Data Visualization
Generates the following visualizations:
1. **Line Chart**: Shows trends over time (e.g., time-series data).
2. **Bar Chart**: Compares a numerical value across categories (e.g., average values per category).
3. **Histogram**: Displays the distribution of a numerical column.
4. **Scatter Plot**: Visualizes the relationship between two numerical columns.

Each plot is customized with:
- Titles
- Axis labels
- Gridlines for better readability

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the same directory as the script or provide the correct file path.
2. Update the column names in the script to match your dataset's structure:
   - `CATEGORY_COLUMN`
   - `NUMERICAL_COLUMN`
   - `NUMERICAL_COLUMN_1`
   - `NUMERICAL_COLUMN_2`
   - `TIME_COLUMN`
   - `VALUE_COLUMN`
3. Run the script using:
```bash
python assignment_week7.py
```
4. The script will:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Perform basic analysis.
   - Generate visualizations.

## Error Handling
- If the dataset file is not found, the script will display an error message and exit.
- If required columns are missing, the script will skip the corresponding analysis or visualization and display a warning.

## Example Output
### Sample Analysis
- Basic statistics for numerical columns.
- Group-wise mean values for a categorical column.

### Sample Visualizations
1. **Line Chart**: Trends over time.
2. **Bar Chart**: Comparison across categories.
3. **Histogram**: Distribution of a numerical column.
4. **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between two numerical columns.

## Customization
- Update the column names to match your dataset.
- Modify the visualization styles using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` settings.

## Notes
- Ensure your dataset is clean and formatted correctly before running the script.
- The script is designed to handle common data issues like missing values and incorrect data types.
